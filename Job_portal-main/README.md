## Overview

**Job Portal** is a MERN-stack recruitment platform designed to provide separate workflows for:

- **Job Seekers / Students** — create an account, manage a profile, upload a resume, browse jobs, view job details, and apply for jobs.
- **Recruiters** — create and manage company profiles, post jobs, view their jobs, and review applicants.

The frontend is built with React and Vite, while the backend exposes REST-style APIs using Express and MongoDB/Mongoose.

The application uses:

- JWT-based authentication
- HTTP-only cookies for authentication tokens
- bcrypt password hashing
- MongoDB for persistent data
- Cloudinary for image/resume uploads
- Redux Toolkit for client-side state management
- Redux Persist for persisting authentication state
- Tailwind CSS and reusable UI components for the interface
- Vercel configuration for deployment

---

## Data Models

### User

The `User` model represents both students and recruiters.

```text
User
├── username
├── email
├── phoneNumber
├── password
├── role
│   ├── student
│   └── recruiter
└── profile
    ├── bio
    ├── skills[]
    ├── resume
    ├── resumeOriginalName
    ├── company
    └── profilePhoto
```

### Company

```text
Company
├── companyName
├── location
├── logo
├── description
├── website
└── userId → User
```

### Job

```text
Job
├── title
├── description
├── salary
├── position
├── experience
├── requirement
├── location
├── jobType
├── createdBy → User
├── company → Company
├── applications[] → Application
└── timestamps
```

### Application

```text
Application
├── job → Job
├── applicant → User
├── status
│   ├── pending
│   ├── accepted
│   └── rejected
└── timestamps
```

### Relationships

```text
User (Recruiter)
      │
      ├──────────────► Company
      │                    │
      │                    └──────────────► Job
      │                                      │
      │                                      └────► Application
      │                                                     │
      └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            User (Student)
```

---

## Authentication & Security

The application uses JWT authentication with an HTTP-only cookie.

### Login Flow

```text
User Login
    │
    ▼
Validate email/password/role
    │
    ▼
Find user in MongoDB
    │
    ▼
Compare password using bcrypt
    │
    ▼
Generate JWT
    │
    ▼
Store JWT in HTTP-only cookie
    │
    ▼
Authenticated requests
```

The authentication middleware:

1. Reads the `token` cookie.
2. Rejects requests without a token.
3. Verifies the JWT using `SECRET_KEY`.
4. Extracts the user's ID.
5. Stores it in `req.id`.
6. Allows the request to continue.

### Security mechanisms currently used

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT authentication
- HTTP-only authentication cookie
- `sameSite: "none"` cookie configuration for cross-origin deployment
- `secure: true` cookie configuration
- CORS with credentials enabled

> For production, add stronger validation, authorization checks, rate limiting, security headers, and stricter ownership checks.

# Frontend Routes

| Route | Page |
|---|---|
| `/` | Home |
| `/login` | Login |
| `/signup` | Signup |
| `/jobs` | Job listing |
| `/jobDescription/:jobId` | Job details |
| `/browse` | Browse jobs |
| `/profile` | User profile |
| `/companies` | Recruiter companies |
| `/company/create` | Create company |
| `/company/:id` | Company setup |
| `/recruiterJob` | Recruiter jobs |
| `/job/create` | Create job |

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory.

Example:

```env
PORT=8000

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret

CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

### Important

Never commit the real `.env` file or production secrets to GitHub.

The frontend currently contains deployed API endpoint constants in:

```text
frontend/src/utils/constant.js
```

For a production-quality project, these URLs should be moved to Vite environment variables.

Example:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com/api
```

---

# Installation & Setup

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Job_portal-main
```

## 2. Install backend dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

## 3. Configure backend environment variables

Create:

```text
backend/.env
```

Add the required MongoDB, JWT, and Cloudinary credentials.

## 4. Start the backend

```bash
npm start
```

or, if using Node directly:

```bash
node app.js
```

The backend is configured around port:

```text
8000
```

## 5. Install frontend dependencies

Open another terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## 6. Start the frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will display the local development URL in the terminal.

---

# Useful Frontend Commands

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview production build

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

---

# Deployment

The repository contains Vercel configuration files:

```text
backend/vercel.json
frontend/vercel.json
```

## Backend Deployment

The backend is configured to use `app.js` as the serverless entry point.

Required production environment variables:

```text
MONGO_URI
SECRET_KEY
CLOUD_NAME
API_KEY
API_SECRET
```

## Frontend Deployment

The frontend is a Vite SPA and includes a Vercel rewrite so client-side routes can resolve correctly.

After deployment, update:

```text
frontend/src/utils/constant.js
```

or preferably use Vite environment variables to point the frontend to the production backend API.

# State Management

Redux Toolkit is used for application-wide state.

### Auth Slice

```text
auth
├── loading
└── user
```

Responsible for:

- Current authenticated user
- Authentication loading state

### Job Slice

```text
job
├── allJobs
├── allAdminJobs
├── singleJob
└── searchJobByText
```

Responsible for:

- Job listing
- Recruiter's jobs
- Selected job
- Job search text

### Company Slice

```text
company
├── singleCompany
├── companies
└── searchCompanyByText
```

Responsible for:

- Selected company
- Recruiter's companies
- Company search text

Redux Persist currently persists the `auth` state in browser storage.

---

# File Uploads

Multer is configured with memory storage:

```text
Multer
   │
   ▼
File Buffer
   │
   ▼
Data URI
   │
   ▼
Cloudinary
   │
   ▼
Secure URL
   │
   ▼
MongoDB
```

Uploaded resources currently include:

- User profile photos
- Resumes
- Company logos

Cloudinary stores the uploaded resource while MongoDB stores the resulting URL.

---

# Error Handling

The backend includes:

### Async wrapper

```text
backend/utils/wrapAsync.js
```

This forwards rejected asynchronous controller operations to Express's error handler.

### Global error handler

`backend/app.js` contains a centralized Express error-handling middleware that returns:

```json
{
  "message": "error message",
  "success": false
}
```

---

# Current Limitations

The following points were identified by reviewing the current source code.

### 1. No separate admin role

The project currently supports:

```text
student
recruiter
```

There is no independent admin authentication/model.

### 2. Application listing endpoint needs improvement

`getAllApplied` currently uses `findOne`, so it returns only one application instead of the complete list of a user's applications.

For a complete application history, it should use:

```js
Application.find({ applicant: userId })
```

### 3. Some frontend UI is still static

The `AppliedJobTable` currently contains hard-coded sample rows rather than loading application data from the backend.

### 4. Job filters are currently UI-only

The filter component displays options, but the selected values are not yet connected to a backend filtering request.

### 5. Bookmark/save job is not implemented

The UI shows a bookmark icon, but there is currently no saved-jobs model/API workflow.

### 6. Search UI is partially implemented

The backend supports a `keyword` query for jobs, but the home search input is not fully wired to the job search state/API.

### 7. Job update endpoint is incomplete

An `updateJob` controller exists, but it is not registered in the job router and its query currently searches by `userId` rather than a job ID.

### 8. Authorization checks need strengthening

Several protected endpoints verify that a user is authenticated but do not verify ownership/role before modifying or deleting a resource.

For example, a production implementation should verify that the recruiter owns the company/job/application being modified.

### 9. File upload validation should be added

The current upload middleware does not enforce:

- File size limits
- Allowed MIME types
- Resume/document extensions
- Image dimensions

### 10. Backend scripts can be improved

The backend `package.json` currently has no dedicated `dev` or `start` script.

Recommended scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon app.js",
    "start": "node app.js"
  }
}
```
